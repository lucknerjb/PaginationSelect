PaginationSelect
================

jQuery Plugin allowing pagination of a html select with big amounts of data

I have yet to create a demo site and write some documentation for this plugin but feel free to have a look at the index.html file to see how to implement the plugin

Questions? Comments? Want to help me out with this plugin?
